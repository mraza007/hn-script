## HackerNews Script.
As an avid consumer of `hackernews`, I decided to write a simple script that will grab top stories with more than `25 points` from `hackernews` and sends to your email.

## Before you run
- Before you run this script export environment variables on your `terminal`
- `export EMAIL=email that you'll be using to send the links`
- `export PASS=password for the email that you will be using to send the links`
- `export REC_EMAIL=recipient email`

## More about the `script`.
- This is written in `python3`.
- If you like to use this simply add your email to `mail_server` function and also don't forget to add the email that you'll use to send the news.
- Lastly if you like `hackernews` articles delivered to your email every night feel free to dm me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/muhammad_o7)

#### END RESULT
